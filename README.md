# WeatherApp

I'm creating this weather app for the purpose of practicing Angular.

## Running the app locally
Always use `npm install` first to get the project started.
Then use `ng serve` to start serving the local server.
Accessing the page at [localhost:4200](localhost:4200).

## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
